## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a **crypto-price-alerts** application would integrate with major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

It's crucial to understand that such an application acts as a **middleware layer** or a **central command center**, orchestrating actions across multiple exchanges based on user-defined rules.

---

### Core Concept: The Integration Architecture

The integration is not a direct, peer-to-peer connection but is achieved through the exchanges' publicly available **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**. The entire system can be broken down into three main layers:

1.  **User Interface & Logic Layer (The crypto-price-alerts App):** Where users set their rules, view their portfolio, and manage strategies.
2.  **Integration & Execution Layer (The App's Backend):** The brain of the operation, which connects to the exchanges.
3.  **Exchange Layer (Binance, Coinbase, etc.):** The platforms that hold the assets and execute the trades.

Here‚Äôs a visual representation of the data flow:
